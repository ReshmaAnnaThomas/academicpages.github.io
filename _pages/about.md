I am a postdoctoral researcher at [ASTRON](https://www.astron.nl) or the Netherlands institute of Radio Astronomy in Dwingeloo, The Netherlands. I work with Prof. dr. Jason Hessels and the [Astroflash research group](https://astroflash-frb.github.io/team.html) to uncover not-so-fast radio transients with [LOFAR](https://www.astron.nl/telescopes/lofar/). I received my PhD from West Virginia University in December 2024, where I worked with [Prof. Sarah Burke-Spolaor](https://sarahspolaor.faculty.wvu.edu/) on the thesis titled [The Search, The Localization, and the Characterization: Fast Radio Transients](https://researchrepository.wvu.edu/etd/12680/). I am also a part of the [realfast](http://realfast.io/about/) collaboration at the [Very Large Array (VLA)](http://www.vla.nrao.edu/). My research focuses on searching for fast radio transients in both time- and imaging-domain data, localizing, characterizing, and figuring out where they came from, what produces them and how we can use them to study the Universe.

You can see my publications [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/OUKtvXIFR6C-5THj23_Apw) or on the Publications Tab on the top right. 

I was born and brought up in a small southern Indian State called [Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala), where I did my schooling till 12th grade. 
Driven by my passion for Physics, I moved to a little town called [Pondicherry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry), about 550 km from my hometown, to pursue a 5-year Integrated M.Sc in Physics. Pondicherry is a union territory of India and is a coastal town which was once a French colony.

My family was supportive throughout every step of my life, and I consider myself lucky for that. I want to use my privilege to raise awareness among underprivileged people about the importance of education and financial independence, especially among women.
